/**
 * AnnotationController — uniform mutation surface for the editor across
 * local-only and live-room modes.
 *
 * App.tsx calls `controller.add/update/remove/clear` without caring whether
 * state is owned by `useState` (local mode) or by `useCollabRoom` (room mode).
 * Previously every mutation site in App.tsx called `setAnnotations(prev => ...)`
 * directly; that pattern does not compose with the server-authoritative
 * write model of live rooms.
 *
 * One field is implementation-specific and optional:
 *   - `setAll` — local mode only. Exposed for `useSharing` (shared-URL
 *     import) and draft-restore paths that need to REPLACE the entire list
 *     atomically. Room mode cannot express "replace all" as a single
 *     protocol op; callers must branch on `controller.setAll`.
 *
 * `pending` holds operations that have been sent but whose echo hasn't
 * arrived yet. Keyed by id with the op kind attached. The room-mode
 * reconciliation is kind-specific:
 *   - add:    clears only when the id appears in room.annotations;
 *             unrelated seq advances must NOT clear, or the optimistic
 *             row in `pendingAdditions` would lose its "Sending…" chrome.
 *   - update: clears once room.seq > sentAtSeq (concurrent supersession
 *             is fine — canonical list shows the winning value).
 *   - remove: clears once room.seq > sentAtSeq (no optimistic row to
 *             strand; spurious clear on remove-of-absent is harmless).
 * See `useAnnotationController.ts` for the full rationale.
 *
 * `failed` holds entries whose last send attempt rejected. Each carries
 * kind + payload so the UI can offer per-op Retry/Discard without the
 * caller holding onto the original Annotation reference. Slice 5 is
 * online-only — failed ops do NOT auto-replay on reconnect.
